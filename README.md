# twentyeyes_api
API to store and retrieve blog posts for 20eyes.org

The idea here is to create an API that will perform simple CRUD functions on a Postgres DB.  

DB will be small forever so
I'll be working on it with a local DB instance and then just create a duplicate when it's ready to go live.
