  "title": "2/6/2015: Hound Search 2: Son of hound search, and other updates!",
  "post": "What a week. First off, I added a very adorable little script to my post Jenkins web build that initiates a git pull for all of the repos that are searchable within hound. I tried to change the css but that turned out horribly so original css remains! Eventually I'm going to create a separate jenkins job for this and trigger a pull when any repo gets a commit to master. If you'd like to take a look at the script you can on my github page.  Work related I finally found a really good, very concise ruby gem to write our QA chat bot called xmpp4r-robot owner about it and he mentioned he may not have the time to work on it personally, but will definitely accept pull requests. I think I'm going to do it, the MUC library for XMPP4R doesn't seem THAT bad. Only a few very minor tweaks to Rundeck and I think I can shift in to only supporting the system and no longer actively adding or testing jobs. I'm sure that sooner or later there will be more tasks to add. **Edit: Pretty sure Hound    already initiates a pull on a scheduled basis, rendering that little script I wrote pretty worthless, but fun to write all the same!"
