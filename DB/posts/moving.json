  "post": "Well Looks like I'll be moving to NYC on July 31st, very excited for that! I'm also ditching rackspace to go with Digital Ocean. I'm ditching rackspace because Digital Ocean is way cheaper I get double the RAM rackspace was giving me BYE FELICIARACKSPACE. I've been experiencing crazy amounts of burnout at work and it's beggining to really effect my free time. Typically on the weekend I usually try checking out new tools I've read about during the week or continue work on ongoing projects, but lately I just haven't felt like doing it. I've decided to put the breaks on doing work stuff during non work hours for the time being. I've been slowly getting back in to ruby and working a lot on TDD using test-unit"
