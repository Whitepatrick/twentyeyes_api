  "post": "Hello there! Since moving over to digital ocean for my web/utility VMs I've had a few upgrades. I'm currently collecting and indexing all my system logs and apache logs on cthulhu (VM1). Hastur is the second VM which does most of the behind the scenes work and is also running my jenkins instance. Eventually I'll add in a section to query live site metrics from elasticsearch. In bigger news, I've got a working alpha version of my new and improved version of this page using  %a{:href => 'http://http://www.sinatrarb.com/', :target => '_blank'} Sinatra and  %a{:href => 'http://getbootstrap.com/', :target => '_blank'} Bootstrap. I've still got some tweaking to do but it's a first step towards making this page a little more mobile friendly and visually appealing. I don't have to stomach to go full geocities so I'll just move up to the late 2000's B-)"
