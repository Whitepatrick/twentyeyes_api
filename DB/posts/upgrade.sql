  "post": "After reading a ton about Docker late one night before an early work day so obviously I didn't finish restoring the previous workflow I had using Jenkins to deploy this stuff to a production server. LESSONS LEARNED: Have a plan! I really should have known this wasn't as simple as backing up my old config and system files. If I had taken the time to write down what I wanted, and the absolute minimum things required to get it running, things would have run a whole lot smoother. Don't be scared! I avoided this upgrade for a while because I was making too big of a deal about going dark for a little. The upgrade process is a process I've done several times on local machines, doing it on a remote server was no different at all. Jenkins rules! I'm fortunate enough at work to be able to use Atlassian tools, but I think considering my past experiences with Jenkins, I've grown to be somewhat partial to it. Bamboo is a phenomenal tool, but I will always pick Jenkins given the choice between the two.Whoa, Docker.. My original plan was to drop a few containers on here to see exactly how portable thye are. It definitely isn't as easy as I assumed it would be, but actually gets more and more interesting the more I learn about it. More to come from this for sure. IN OTHER NEWS! Etsy engineers Daniel Schauenberg and Ryan Frantz are coming to DC next month to speak about their engineering practices at Etsy and I am beyond stoked!! I got a new bike"
