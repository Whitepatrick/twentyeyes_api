Needless to say I've been smashing my head against my keyboard for a little while now and the fix still escapes me. I'm almost certain the issue is a js file not being read properly, but I'll have to investigate more another time, since I don't want to take up my whole Sunday fiddling with a hamburger button! In other news, I made an about me page,  %a{:href => '/about_me'} check it out!"
